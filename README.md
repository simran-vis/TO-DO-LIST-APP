# TO-DO-LIST-APp
I recently developed a to-do list app as part of my internship at CipherByte Technologies. Here's an overview of its features and functionality:

Key Features:
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks with a simple input field and an 'Add' button.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list by clicking the 'Delete' button next to each task.

Mark as Completed: Toggle tasks as completed by clicking on them, visually differentiating completed tasks from pending ones.

Persistent Storage: Utilizes local storage to save tasks, ensuring they remain even after closing the browser.


Technologies Used:
HTML: Structured the content of the app.

CSS: Styled the app for an intuitive and responsive user interface.

JavaScript: Implemented functionality for adding, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.

Challenges and Learning:
Developing this app allowed me to tackle common web development challenges such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage management. It was a great opportunity to apply my knowledge in a practical setting and improve my coding skills.

Looking forward to the next project and continuing to learn and grow! ðŸš€
